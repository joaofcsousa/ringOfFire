Ready to get your drink on? Here's what you need to do:

Fill up your cup with your drink of choice. We're not judging, so go ahead and pick whatever makes you happy.
Set an empty cup next to all the players. This cup will come up later, so don't worry about it just yet!
We're gonna go in order of arrival.
If you want, you have the option to play with more then one drink (madness)! In that case you'll need more cups.
Each player will be assigned a card randomly and must follow the rule associated. 

Have fun and drink (ir)responsably!
